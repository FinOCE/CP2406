# [Quiz on chapter 1](https://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c1/quiz.html)

## Question 1

*One of the components of a computer is its *CPU.* What is a CPU and what role does it play in a computer?*

The CPU is the "brain" of the computer. It is a single chip that is in charge of executing programs.

## Question 2

*Explain what is meant by an "asynchronous event." Give some examples.*

Asynchronous events don't run in a predetermined order like synchronous events, and instead executes when available using interrupts. Some examples of asynchronous events are requesting data from an API, awaiting the completion of a promise, etc.

## Question 3

*What is the difference between a "compiler" and an "interpreter"?*

A compiler compiles the high-level code and other languages into machine-code that can be run by the computer. An interpreter however, translates code instruction-by-instruction as required. It acts like a CPU with a kind of fetch-and-execution cycle.

## Question 4

*Explain the difference between high-level languages and machine language.*

High-level languages cannot be run by the machine, and are instead written and formatted to be easily readable for humans. Machine language is what the high-level languages are compiled to and is intended to be readible and fast for the machine.

## Question 5

*If you have the source code for a Java program, and you want to run that program, you will need both a compiler and an interpreter. What does the Java compiler do, and what does the Java interpreter do?*

The compiler compiles the Java language into machine language, where the interpreter then makes that compiled code runnable by any Java-supported device.

## Question 6

*What is a subroutine?*

A subroutine is a set of instructions grouped together and given a name. They are intended to prevent repeated code, and are basically functions/methods.

## Question 7

*Java is an object-oriented programming language. What is an object?*

An object is a module which contains several subroutines and data. Each object can categorise relevant code.

## Question 8

*What is a variable? (There are four different ideas associated with variables in Java. Try to mention all four aspects in your answer. Hint: One of the aspects is the variable's name.)*

A variable is used to represent something. It can be defined and redefined to be used to handle manipulations to data. Some examples of variables in Java are strings, integers, floats, booleans, etc.

## Question 9

*Java is a "platform-independent language." What does this mean?*

Because Java is platform-independent, it can be run on a variety of devices. The compiled machine language can be interpreted to be run on many different devices, with different hardware and software.

## Question 10

*What is the "Internet"? Give some examples of how it is used. (What kind of services does it provide?)*

The internet is a web of interconnected devices that is used to transmit and receive information globally. It allows for websites and other services to be hosted and accessed from anywhere in the world.
